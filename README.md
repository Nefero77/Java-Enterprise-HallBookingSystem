# Java-Enterprise-HallBookingSystem
#This is my project for Object Oriented Development with Java assigned by my university APU for Outcome Based Learning.
#A simple Java desktop app for managing hall bookings with different user roles—Admin, Manager, Scheduler, and Customer. 
Each user gets their own dashboard to perform tasks like booking, scheduling, or managing users. Built using Java Swing 
and basic OOP, it’s a clean and practical solution for handling hall reservations in schools, offices, or events.
